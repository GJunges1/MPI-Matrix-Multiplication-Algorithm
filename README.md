# MPI-Matrix-Multiplication-Algorithm
This project was implemented as an activity of a Distributed Systems discipline (UTFPR).

Both parallel (with MPI) and serial (without MPI) versions of a Matrix Multiplication Algorithm were implemented.

P.S.: THEY ARE STILL IN BETA, SO THE RESULTS ARE NOT RELIABLE. IF YOU WANT TO USE IT YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE ITS MULTIPLICATION IS WORKING PROPERLY FIRST!
